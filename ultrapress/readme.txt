A lightweight, no-bloat SEO plugin for WordPress that focuses on the absolute essentials to improve your rankings without slowing down your site.

== Description ==

There are many fantastic SEO plugins available, but they often try to pack in as many features as possible. The irony is that this can lead to a slower website and a confusing user experience, which ultimately hurts the SEO you're trying to improve.

**ultrapress takes a different, balanced approach.**

Our philosophy is simple: provide only the essential, high-impact SEO features your website truly needs. We give you the tools to control how search engines see your site, without the unnecessary features that weigh it down.

With ultrapress, you get:

*   **Custom SEO Titles:** Take full control over the title tags for your posts and pages.
*   **Custom Meta Descriptions:** Write compelling meta descriptions to increase click-through rates from search results.
*   **Extreme Performance:** No bloat. Our plugin is built to be incredibly lightweight and fast, ensuring it never slows down your admin dashboard or your live site.
*   **Intuitive Interface:** A simple meta box that integrates perfectly into your post editing screen. No complex settings pages to navigate.

If you are tired of overly complicated SEO plugins and want a fast, focused, and effective solution, ultrapress is the perfect choice.

== Installation ==

1.  Upload the `ultrapress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.  Go to any post or page editor. You will now see the "ultrapress SEO Settings" box where you can add your custom SEO title and meta description.
