== Installation ==

1. Upload the `ultrapress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an API key to use this plugin? =

Yes. To power the AI features (both chatbot and SEO generation), you need an API key from either OpenAI, Google (for Gemini), or DeepSeek. You can configure this in the "AI Brain" settings page.

= Can I customize the chatbot's appearance? =

Absolutely! The "Chatbot" settings page gives you full control over the position, spacing, colors, icon, welcome message, header text, and more.

= Does the SEO feature work with page builders like Elementor? =

For AI generation, the plugin works best with the standard WordPress editor (including Gutenberg), as it can reliably read the content. Support for specific page builders may be added in future updates. The manual SEO fields will work with any post type.
